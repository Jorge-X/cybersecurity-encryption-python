# cybersecurity encryption python

####  Here encryption is done with python 
``` The libraries used are "os" and "pyaes" ```

When the code is executed it uses a file called “teste.txt”, it reads and encrypts the file, deleting the old file and generating a new name teste.txt.ransomwaretroll. Now the file is fully AES encrypted.
In the decryption process, the opposite happens, it undoes the encryption and restores the original file name
